        "# Comma Restoration with Token Classification using BERT\n",
        "This notebook fine-tunes a transformer encoder (e.g., mBERT, LvBERT) to restore commas in text as a token classification task. Each token receives one of two labels: COMMA (a comma should follow this word) or O (no comma). At inference time, existing commas are stripped, labels are predicted, and the sentence is rebuilt by inserting commas after tokens predicted as COMMA.\n",
